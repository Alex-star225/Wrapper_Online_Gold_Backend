<p style="display: none;">Wrapper Online newer version was created by Danielius Paulavičius. Also you know that "patching", "raiding", "crashing", "reporting Vyond", "hacking", "telling owner to take it down" will NOT work! Patching will do nothing. Raiding this website have no uploads. Crashing this website will restart and back up again. Reporting Vyond will do nothing, because we're in Lithuania, and you can't do things to me. Hacking will do nothing (also it's very impossible to hack a owner's ASUS X52J laptop, you need hacking tools to be smartest hacker). And last one is you can't force me to take it down, we are communities, and you don't have permission to talk that.</p>
<div style="display: none;">
<p>Danielius Paulavičius (born on January 8th, 2006, age 14, location Lithuania, Šilalės raj., Kaltinėnai, Gineikiai, Akmenos g. 17, 8th grade middle school) is a BonziWORLD hoster, Samsung SGH Fan, LG Fan, Verizon fan, Wrapper Online hoster (aka GoAnimate Remastered hoster), Super Mario fan, Sonic the Hedgehog fan, PPSSPP gamer, Vegas Pro composer, YTPMVer, YouTuber, YouTube Pooper, Sparta Remixer, Logo editor, Nokia fan, Minecrafter, Flipline Studios fan, Bejeweled fan, Samsung fan. It was born after the mother's age died due to unknown cause, now it have another mother (I DON'T GIVE MY FAMILY NAMES TO BE EXPOSED OR ELSE I WILL GET TOO MUCH TROUBLE LIKE DIOGO MENDES DOGGIS FROM PORTUGUESE), David and Danielius was been punched back in 2015. On 2017, Danielius have a point and found a site called (bonziworld.com), for a few moments later, it has shutting down because I told him to shut down this website and ItzCrazyScout had a point to know his name called "BonziWORLD: Revived" back to 2018 or 2019, I started to hate Seamusmario 55 on 2019 because I am kiddie. I started hating Nathan Thompson (BagelChip) on bonzi.world because I got permanently banned from the website and there's some interesting issue: she gave me the seizure with Staggering Beauty sound, then Google searches potatoes, it's like the "dangerous JS".</p>
<p>And also why I have hosting this website? When I was 11 years old, I saw the video with GoAnimate grounded videos out of troublemakers like Caillou Anderson or Dora the Explorer. Before I start making grounded videos without GoAnimate isn't just be no account, no creation, I made with John voice as Eric voice I grounded TheKantapapa k on YouTube channel. I made 3,600 subs on my channel called "onute saulute thekantapapa", then I had to close it forcely by the social worker, however it was been grounded for the first time, you know is strange? Strangeous things. I have no idea how they have to know us? You should to complain like Onute Saulute do not make videos out of me or I will get a trouble, when I say that mail isn't just horribly given, I will die and I will be ripped at gravestone some of judge. Please don't make me ripped, otherwise you're going to give you the porn at you then you get trouble back.</p>
<p>On the latest months we are partners of the BonziWORLD. I was good for ICS, then for November 21th time I see that the phone number will BARELY continue Discord. This is softlock. This is your problem, not mine. Simultaneously, while we ashamed with this, I have no sense to talk him.</p>
<p>This is the chance it's "unpatchable" site that you can't do everything. Unrestricted options help. I will host on Cloudflare if you don't stop raiding this both websites to us, I will probably hide my IP address, I will ban all anonymous IP address that who made such of a bad content out of me. Before we use Cloudflare, I will not just be DDoS attacked ever again, you can't do it, man. Or it's the Technicolor router which I have it, because ADB Broadband is just poor router and firewall have broken as well. ISP is Telia Lietuva, you can't attack an ISP until you will decide the proportion. Apologies will be unacceptable if you try to attack more and more IPs, I will eventually call the police and arrest you forever and ever and ever and ever and ever then you are grounded grounded grounded grounded grounded grounded grounded grounded grounded for 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 years until you escape the  jail go to your room now and never escape when forever years is over.</p>
